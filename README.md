# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

-The client of the DriverPass project was DriverPass. They wanted a system that would allow students to learn how to drive with material made available online, learn the rules of their local DMV, and to have the ability to schedule road lessons as well.


What did you do particularly well?

-What I did particularily well was taking the concepts given to me by the client and turning them into different models. This allows you to have multiple perspectives on the project and get a better idea of what is going on.


If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

-I would pick the UML class diagram to revise. Since it was not required, I did not go into a great amount of detail in the UML class diagram, so if I could go back and change something, I definitely would go back and change that because I believe that it was due more justice than just what was assigned.


How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

-I interpreted the user's needs by trying to consider their needs as my own. If I take on their needs as my own and pretend as if it is me that I am designing the program for, then it becomes much more easy to interpret and design for the user's needs. It is so important to consider the user's needs when designing because they will be the actual user of the product -- the end user. If you are not considering them when you are coding and are just worried about the project, then you have lost sight in what is important when coding.


How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

-I approach designing software through the lens of a user that knows nothing. If you are able to make your design transparent in such a way that even the most unintuitive people are able to grasp it, then you have done your job as a designer swimmingly. In the future, I would certainly make use of all the diagrams that were talked about in this course. I have used them in the past before this course, but I never had the chance to actually use it for something *relatively* important until I was doing it for this class. Before, I had jsut used them for fun projects. It gave a new light and a much more refined perspective on the charts and graphs discussed.
